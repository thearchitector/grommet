This is a template for implementation plans of a project, or series of tasks, as prompted by a user.

Each section is a self-contained item with a rationale, tasks, and implementation notes. Always keep sections grounded
in reality, not aspirational. Prefer to do research now to generate a more detaliled plan, rather than steps to do
research in the plan itself. The goal of the plan is to produce a set of discrete, easy to follow, and unambigious tasks.

Sections are ordered by priority and dependency. Typically, larger items can be tackled first.

NEVER include citations in this document. If you need to cite something, include either a link to the source or
a small fence block.

NEVER include these instructions in the output.
